//! OBARCH-2 - the VENDORED case: the Open Banking Standard is
//! published by Open Banking Limited under the MIT Open Licence
//! (openbanking.org.uk/open-licence), so this adapter MAY carry the
//! OB resource paths in its published spec **with the OBL copyright
//! notice preserved**. The utoipa aggregate below therefore grows
//! to include the OB resource annotations as the wire lands
//! (OBARCH-7), and the OBL notice travels in the spec's info block.
//!
//! The drift guard (`tests/openapi_publication.rs`) asserts the
//! notice is present and that OB paths conform to the versioned
//! prefix (`/open-banking/v{maj}.{min}/...`) - the inverse of the
//! US/CA policy.
